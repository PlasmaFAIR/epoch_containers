# TODO.md

- Better scripting interface
- Finish updating README
- On running, Epoch complains that it can't find `src/physics_packages/TABLES`.
  Is this something we can fix here?
- Need to add more variants with different compiler flag combinations.
- There may be issues with Singualarity's cache dir being in the home directory by
  default. More investigation is needed.
